We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.\nOur goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day.\nWhat You'll do in this Role?\nAs a Manager, you will report directly to a Senior Manager or Director and be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of decisioning models and supporting analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – the risk decisioning models used by 2 or more of the bank’s retail and small business product lines, across the entire customer lifecycle. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Model Operations, Product, Risk Strategy & Risk Management, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Legal, Compliance and Audit.\nYour team will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on-premise GPU computing, open source Jupyter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.\nUnder the guidance of your Director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction models that will be used potentially millions of times, every year and therefore need to be not only accurate and precise, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure and useful.

We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.\nTo be a Manager in Retail Models & Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great.

      "description": "“If you are interested in applying computational biology to real-world applications that could potentially lead to publishable research work, this is the right opportunity for you. Be a part of the team of research and machine learning scientists and get mentored by some of the best minds in AI.”-- Shazan Jabbar, Lead Machine Learning Scientist and Mara Cairo, Product Owner, Apprenticeships*About AmiiOne of Canada’s three main institutes for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, our world-renowned researchers drive fundamental and applied research at the University of Alberta (and other academic institutions), training some of the world’s top scientific talent. Our cross-functional teams work collaboratively with Alberta-based businesses and organizations to build AI capacity and translate scientific advancement into industry adoption and economic impact.The Project:In this project we propose to start by building on two current approaches for predicting relative biomolecule abundance that have shown promise in other species and for which NRC-generated data is available or planned. The approaches that are identified to investigate further are: 1) Ortholog contrast models and 2) Massively parallel reporter-based models. Both of these approaches take advantage of the recent advancement in deep learning models. NRC data will be limited to sequence information from plant protein crops, specifically canola and pulses (peas, lentils), with priority given to seed-related traits. As a first step, the above existing approaches will be validated by reproducing the published results. Then those calibrated models will be applied to NRC data. Following this demonstration, the focus will shift to ways to improve the model performance. Possible avenues to explore here would include feature engineering, data expansion, transfer-learning, and addressing data-quality issues.The outcome of this project will be a first generation of predictive models of molecular phenotype (aka endophenotype) abundance. These models are expected to have wide ranging utility for crop improvement. By providing a means to elevate trait associations and modelling to a functional level (i.e. transcript, protein or gene/functional dosage), these types of models are expected to drive a paradigm shift in breeding and trait development.The project will be executed across a two-year time period, and Amii will onboard a number of consecutive interns over the course of the project. The interns will work under the supervision of an Amii Lead Scientist for the duration of their internship. Internships start at 4 months with the possibility of extension of up to 12 months.Required Skills / ExpertiseWe’re looking for a talented and enthusiastic Intern with a strong knowledge of computational biology and machine learning.Key responsibilities: Build, train, and evaluate ML modelsUndertake applied research on ML techniques to address the limitations in existing modelsRequirements: At least one year into a CS / ML graduate program, MSc. or PhD.Research and/or applied project experience in computational biology and related Deep Learning Technologies (e. g.

      "description": "Our Team\nLet’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.\nOur team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn Startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for start-ups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are TechStars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!\nOur Culture\nCulture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value innovation, dependability, and accessibility. In our product, we value simplicity, affordability, and informability.\nIn engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).\nOur mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk.\nOur Product\nEvery day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.\nWhile the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.\nUsing our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.\nAbout the role and where do you fit? Great question.\nAbout the Role:\nAfter securing their $10M CAD Series-A round in December 2019, and a $21M CAD Series-B in June of 2021, SkyWatch is on the pathway to scale. Reporting to our Head of Analytics, you will be responsible for building upon the foundation set up by our awesome Data Engineering team. As a Data Scientist at SkyWatch, you will use state-of-the-art analytic and predictive methods to help us turn data into business insights. You will work with stakeholders in product, engineering, revenue and our leadership team to measure business performance, provide deep analyses, and predict future trends.\nAbout You:\nYou have energy, experience and a passion for big data and the process of scaling.\nYou love working in fast-paced environments and love making an impact.\nYou are an exceptional communicator with the ability to translate technical concepts into easy-to-understand language for our stakeholders.\nYou have an excitement for working with a remote team; you value collaborating on problems, asking questions, delivering feedback, and supporting others in their goals.\nTechnical Arsenal:\nYou have a solid understanding of data science tools and libraries (Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Spark)\nYou have experience with applied statistical methods, modelling and machine learning (regression, clustering, survival analysis, decision trees, neural networks, etc.)\nYou have strong software development fundamentals and are comfortable developing and scaling ELT pipelines\nYou understand AB Testing and the statistics which underpin the process\nYou have experience creating success criteria and metrics for products with an emphasis on measuring what's important\nYou are able to clearly communicate business insights by turning raw data into actionable recommendations\nSkyWatch is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity in the workplace.

      "description": "=FRANÇAIS CI-DESSOUS=\nDo you want to make models that matter?\nShine at family dinners explaining the work you do that they can, at last, understand and be impacted by?\nHear that doctors are excited to learn that you found a new way to improve people's healthcare?\nRead patient testimonials that explain how much their lives are made better because of their magical doctors and nurses?\nIf, for you, it never is about the diploma or the job, but the science and the data!\nIf, for you, using your maths skills and your magnificent brain to build modern models and applications that serve people is more important than predicting ad prices.\nIf for you, discovering new algorithms, new technics and new patterns is happiness in a jar, and you dream of starting something big from scratch (or almost).\nIf you want to learn from experimented colleagues and mentors, and occasionally (very often) laugh\nIf you want to refine the technics and practices that make data science not just a fancy job title but ultimately, O, so fulfilling.\nIf you're ready for a challenge and wake up every day with the feeling of having something exciting to do in a domain that will help us get through any pandemic?\nSimply Apply\n...need more?\n...Want to know who we are?\nWe're a young startup, with a bold AND ambitious, AND realistic goal: make health professionals adopt telemedicine with bliss.\nIt all started 2 years ago when two out-of-residency dermatologists (Emilie and Marc-André) and Marc-André's brother (Jean-Philippe) decided there had to be a better way to care for patients. They looked around and found no such solution, so they stitched up their own. Piece by piece, they built something they could love: Dermago (dermago.ca) a modern virtual dermatology clinic. For a time, it was enough.\nBut one day, a private clinic approached them to ask if they could, too, use it to enter the modern age. Of course, they said! yes! And Dermago grew, a bit. And then another asked. And then another. So they started to grow, more steadily each time.\nBut then, COVID happened and they were flooded with demands. They sat down with a consultant, asked for advice, and brainstormed. Quickly, the answer was obvious: build a technology company and take all that they had learned over the last two years to build a customizable, secure, private, smart, user and doctor friendly, modern, reasonably-priced telemedicine platform.\nAnd that's what you, as a part of the Technology team, will build!\n...What kind of person do we need, you ask?\nPassionate about software and how magic it can become in the right hands: yours!\nDriven to make software and data science/machine learning both efficient, privacy-aware and ethic\nInclined to use, participate, and maybe contribute in open-source technologies and their ecosystem\nEntry-level or junior is ok if you have made something worth talking about: don't be shy, show us!\nFor the more experienced, the bar will be as high as you can make it: we're a small team (for now) so, no mental shackles and asking if you can. just. do. it.\n...What Tiks our Toks? how do you fit?\nWe do modern telemedicine, so yeah, we are modern: remote work, cloud technologies, recent languages, Agility, DevOps and best software practices are our bread and butter. If you like to do COBOL on a mainframe, we respect that. But our joy will be different.\nWe have the customers, the doctors love us, but we need to build the best platform for them: so better be unafraid to try stuff, write an amazing React component, scratch it for a Svelte one, or fall back on doing it server-side. The craft never stops. We'll be learning every day.\nWe're just starting but still, our team is strong: from the technology to our product, marketing and advisors, we look for the best or we coach, mentor and grow them, prepare to become world-class, if you already are, prepare to redefine what it means\n...Curious about the challenges? Come tackle those:\nOur platform sustains all legal requirements you can throw at it: PEPIDA, HIPAA, GDPR. For us it's a baseline, we sleep soundly when the patient and doctor are the only ones to access records\nAin't no time to wait for the page to refresh: doctors and patients need it to be easy, reactive, and pleasant\nData grows fast, models need to be retrained, answers still need to be given in a timely manner: it is local but we will scale, prepare the Terabyte SSD\nSome of our users will prefer to look it up quickly on their smartwatch, others will want to be at a desk to think about it: we don't stop at any device, we serve all, whatever the format\n...So what's success?\nElbow-hugs if you like them (it's a COVID thing now), or just hand-washed high-fives\nSimple \"Thank you\"s or big gesture, a startup can lead to big rewards too\nYour family or friends asking you if the fantastic platform they used to care for the health of a loved one is the thing you're working on\nhappy doctors and happy nurses, which means happy patients, which means healthy people! everybody wins\n\n...Stuff that will help you succeed as a Data Science team member?\nHaving done something, even if it's a spectacular university work you're proud of, we're sure there's a reason why\nGood knowledge of machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their real-world advantages/drawbacks\nStrong grasp of statistical theory and practice\nStrong programming skills in Python programming language\nExperience working with ML development frameworks and libraries (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch etc.)\nFamiliarity with application deployment using Docker, Virtual Machines, API and GCP\nFamiliarity with SQL or other query languages\n\n...Remote? Benefits?\nWhen it comes to where you should live, the more talented and experienced you are and the less we care.\nWhy? Because when you start your career, we believe you should be nearer your peers, be able to sit physically down with them, and get the 60% of communication you don't get using Zoom.\nWe do have some rules of thumb though:\nBe ± 3 hours timezone-wise\nSpeak English and/or French. Only English is fine.\nIn Canada. Outside of that, the administrative and tax complication is too much (for now\nAsk for an ou benefits package, this is already too long... :)\n\n=VERSION FRANÇAISE=\nTu veux créér des models qui font la différence?\nTu veux enfin briller aux diners de famille en parlant de sujets qui les intéresse et les touche: la santé?\nEntendre des Docteurs excités d'apprendre qu'on lance une nouvelle version?\nLire des témoignages de patients qui racontent combien leur vie est meilleure parce que leurs Docteurs et leurs Infirmières sont juste magiques?\nSi pour toi, la science des données, ca n'est pas juste avoir diplôme ou un titre, mais ta science.\nSi pour toi, ce qui compte c'est utiliser tes talents et tes brillants neurones pour construire des modèles rigoureux et utiles, pas vendre des pubs.\nSi pour toi, découvrir de nouveaux algorithmes, techniques et patterns c'est le bonheur en boite, et tu rêves de commencer quelque chose d'ambitieux from scratch (ou presque)\nSi tu veux apprendre d'un leadership et de mentors expérimentés et occasionnellement drôles.\nSi affiner tes pratiques pour deployer des modèles complexes et riches qui fonctionnent c'est un challenge mais c'est, ô, combien épanouissant.\nSi tu est prête( e ) pour un challenge et te lever chaque jour avec la certitude d'avoir quelque chose d'excitant à construire dans un domaine qui va nous aider tous à traverser toutes les maudites futures pandémies?\nIl suffit d'appliquer.\n...besoin de plus d'infos?\n...Qui on est?\nNous sommes une jeune startup avec un plan ambitieux ET réaliste: rendre l'adoption de la télémédecine par les professionnels de santé un bonheur.\nTout a commencé il y a 2 ans, quand 2 dermatologues ayant terminé leur résidence (Émilie et Marc-André) discutent avec le frère de Marc-André (Jean-Philippe) pour trouver une meilleure façon de prendre soin de leurs patients. Ils cherchent, mais ne trouvent rien qu'ils voudraient utiliser pour eux. Ils decident alors d'assembler quelque chose par eux-même. Pièce par pièce, ils rapiècent une application qu'ils commencent à aimer : Dermago (http://dermago.ca), une clinique de dermatologie virtuelle moderne.\nEt pour un temps, ca leur suffit. Mais quelques mois plus tard, une clinique privée les approche pour savoir s'ils peuvent, eux aussi, l'utiliser. Biensur, ils répondent ! Évidement ! Et Dermago grandit. Un peu. Puis, une autre clinique de super-infirmière fait la meme demande. Et une autre...Et Dermago grossit, de façon plus soutenu a chaque fois.\nUn jour, COVID arrive. A partir de là, ils se retrouvent à deux doigts d'être débordé par les demandes. Ils cherchent conseil auprès d'experts sur la stratégie et de conseillers en croissance. Après un temps de reflexion pour s'accorder sur ce qu'ils veulent vraiment construire, ils tombent sur la réponse la plus évidente: une compagnie de technologie qui incorporerait tout ce qu'ils ont appris pour livrer un plateforme de télémédecine moderne, personnalisable, sécurisée, abordable, intelligente, protectrice à l'extreme des données personnelles et avec une experience Docteur-Patient de rêve.\nEt ca, c'est la plateforme que tu vas construire avec le reste de l'équipe technique!\n...Quel genre de personnes on cherche, tu te demandes?\navant tout, passionnée( e ) par le logiciel et ce qu'il peut faire entre les bonnes mains: les tiennes!!\npoussée( e ) par le désir de faire de la programmation et de la science des données aussi efficace, respectueuse de la vie privée qu'éthique\nbiaisée( e ) dans l'utilisation, la participation et peut-être meme la contribution aux communautés open-source et leur écosystème\ndébutante( e ) c'est ok, si tu as une réalisation dont ca vaut la peine de parler ensemble: soit pas timide, montres nous!\npour les plus expérimentées( e ), la barre est placée aussi haute que tu la met: on est une petite équipe (pour commencer) donc aucune barrières mentales et besoin de demander l'autorisation. just. do. it.\n...Qu'est ce qui Tiques nos Toques? ...ou tu fit?\non fait de la télémédecine moderne, donc ouais, on est moderne: télétravail, infonuagique, des languages récents, l'Agilité, DevOps et les meilleures pratiques disponibles sont notre pain quotidien. Si tu aimes faire du COBOL sur des mainframes, respect. Mais notre plaisir sera ailleurs.\non a déjà des clients, nos docteurs nous aiment, mais on a besoin de construire une plateforme qui dépasse leurs attentes: alors c'est mieux si t'as pas peur d'essayer des trucs, écrire un composant React impressionnant, le mettre à la poubelle pour le remplacer par une version Svelte, ou finalement le faire coté serveur. La recherche de la meilleure solution ne s'arrête jamais. Du nouveau chaque jour.\non fait que commencer, mais notre équipe est déjà remplie de superstars: de la technologies aux produits, le marketing ou nos conseillers, on trouve les meilleurs où on les coach et mentor pour le devenir : prepare toi à devenir de niveau mondial, ou si tu l'es déjà, à redéfinir ce que ça veux dire\n...Curieux sur nos challenges? Viens donc résoudre ca:\nnotre plateforme supporte toutes les exigences légale que tu peux lui balancer: PEPIDA, HiPaa, GDPR. Pour nous, c'est une baseline : on dort comme des bébés toutes les nuits, sachant que les données de santé des gens sont accessible juste à eux et leurs professionnels de santé\nain't no time for that! d'attendre que la page rafraichisse: nos Docteurs et nos Patients ont une experience facile, étonnement réactive et plaisante, on parle cache\nles données ça pousse sur les disques durs comme des champignons, les modèles ça a besoin d'être mis a jour comme un Windows sans anti-virus, mais les réponses doivent quand même arriver à temps: c'est local mais ca doit scaler, prepares ton SSD\ncertains préfèrent avoir leur réponse rapidement sur leur montre, d'autres sur leur ordinateur de bureau: aucun appareil ne nous arrête, on sert tout le monde, dans tous les formats\n...Ok, c'est quoi le succès chez vous alors?\nDes bises de coudes si vous aimez ca (c'est un truc de COVID), ou juste des high-five avec les mains pleines d'antiseptique\nUn simple \"Merci\" ou des grands gestes, une startup peut aussi donner des grosses récompenses\nVotre famille ou amis qui vous demande si l'extraordinaire plateforme qu'ils ont utilisés pour prendre soin d'un proche c'est ça, votre job?\ndes docteurs et des infirmières heureuses, ce qui veut dire des patients heureux, ce qui veux dire des gens en santé! Tout le monde y gagne\n...Qu'est que ca prend pour réussir comme Data Scientist?\nAu moins une réalisation dont tu es fière, même si c'est \"juste\" des travaux pratiques d'université, c'est certain que t'en as d'autre à venir\nBonne connaissance des algorithmes de machine learning et de deep learning et leurs avantages/inconvénients dans le monde réel\nBonne compréhension de la théorie et de la pratique statistiques\nSolides compétences en programmation dans le langage de programmation Python\nExpérience de travail avec des frameworks et des librairies de développement ML (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.)\nFamiliarité avec le déploiement d'applications à l'aide de Docker, de machines virtuelles, d'API et de GCP\nConnaître SQL ou d'autres langages de requête\n...Remote?

      "description": "Company Description\nShopify is the leading omni-channel commerce platform. Merchants use Shopify to design, set up, and manage their stores across multiple sales channels, including mobile, web, social media, marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up shops. The platform also provides merchants with a powerful back-office and a single view of their business, from payments to shipping. The Shopify platform was engineered for reliability and scale, making enterprise-level technology available to businesses of all sizes. Headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify currently powers over 1,000,000 businesses in approximately 175 countries and is trusted by brands such as Allbirds, Gymshark, PepsiCo, Staples, and many more.\n\nJob Description\nData Science & Engineering is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to provide solutions for our merchants and stakeholders across the organization. From pipelines and schema design to machine learning products and decision support, data science at Shopify is a diverse role with many opportunities to positively impact our success. The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopify’s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of data to work to make our merchants more successful. From delivering merchandising insights to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to the platform via an array of open source tools.\nWe are looking for a Senior Data Science Manager to lead the team that partners with our Operate data team (part of Core). The Shopify Core is what’s “in the box” when merchants sign up for Shopify: the world’s best Online Store, Checkout, and the Admin to set up and run their business. The Operate’s Mission is to help merchants start and run their business on Shopify’s platform by building the most powerful Admin. Operate Data Science and Engineering team contributes to this mission by building best-in-class insights and data products to enable every merchant’s success.\nWhat your role will look like:\nWorking closely with an interdisciplinary team, you and your team will be responsible for the evolution of all admin tools (such as admin home, navigation, search, etc.) across mobile and web and tackle the evolution of how our most sophisticated merchants are utilizing our platform (large organizations with multiple businesses and staff). Your team will focus on developing strong data foundations, data-informed products, and reporting and experimentation frameworks to empower the Operate organization to make great decisions quickly.\n\nQualifications\nYou will need to have:\nTeam development: You’ll need a demonstrated track record of attracting top data/analytics talent, developing those people (both ICs and managers) to make them even better, and managing the growth of teams. You have several years of experience managing and scaling multiple teams.\nData Experience at scale: You’ve been a leader in multiple companies where analytics on top of massive data sets drives product/business decisions and results in powerful data products. You have extensive experience with technologies like SQL, Spark, and Python.\nAnalytics expertise: You’ll need to be amazing at coming up with new, meaningful metrics to measure the success of our products; you'll be equally strong at making sure the data needed to support those metrics are available. You have multiple years of experience managing decisions at scale, including causal inference and experimentation.\nWell-balanced skills: People have trouble pinning you down. Business, product, and technical teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional (and both are exceptionally strong), and you are equally comfortable and effective at presenting to technical or business leaders.\nPassionate about business strategy: You’ve experienced and thrived in similar channel-related environments and have a knack for working with business users that are responsible for top-line growth.\nKey technology stack and tools we work with:\nPython\nSQL\nSpark\nGoogle Cloud Platform\nMode/Tableau\nAdditional Information\nWe know that applying to a new role takes a lot of work and we truly value your time.
