We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About RaceAt Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse. Miranda replied, \"That's just what happens when you go looking for the very best people!\" At Legible, we couldn't agree more!Legible recognizes the right for human beings to self-identify.

Thanks for taking the time to apply!\n\nA little bit about Habanero\nHabanero is a Canadian consulting company with offices in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. We are passionate about helping people and organizations thrive. We believe that every organization can be exceptional, and we help to humanize the world of work through the creation of modern workplaces and the cultural, communication, collaboration and content experiences that power them. Our solutions are globally recognized, and we have consecutively ranked as one of Canada's top ten best places to work for the last 11 years. Habanero is proud to be ranked #9 on the Great Place to Work® Canada List of Best Workplaces™ for 2021.\n\nThe best kind of work\nHabanero is an organization where people who are creative, hard-working, friendly, honest and open come together to do great work. We have a shared passion for solving complex issues that will benefit other people and organizations. We only hire people we can count on, so you can be certain that you are joining a team of happy and competent team members. We service our clients and projects across Canadian time zones and consultants are resourced on cross-regional teams.\n\nSupporting each other in personal growth\nWe are a lattice organization, meaning that there is no traditional hierarchy. There is no typical boss, and you don’t report to a manager. Instead, we have a more holistic approach to mentorship – we offer employee journey coaches who are there to help you with all things career and life. We believe it’s up to you to make the most out of your career, and we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way.\n\nA diverse culture of clever humans\nAt Habanero, we celebrate diversity and inclusivity. We are committed to creating and supporting equal employment opportunities regardless of age, race, ancestry, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. We have included a personalized submission field in our application form to provide an additional opportunity for you to tell your story outside of the traditional resume and cover letter.\n\nCompensation\nOur compensation package includes a technology allowance, a wellness allowance, flexible work hours, the option to work from home, health and dental coverage, a health spending account and RRSP matching. We also enjoy smaller perks like free snacks and drinks and group lunches where you can reconnect with your team after a long week. There are training and development opportunities for those who wish to continue evolving their skills. All employees start at three weeks of vacation.\n\nBringing life to work\nEveryone at Habanero probably has their own story around this, but it's probably safe to say that it starts with people feeling like they can bring their whole selves to work. The cornerstone idea is that we want to support people having great lives, not just great work lives (we can't say our relationship begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00). Other things we've heard make the difference for Habs:\nPeople starting their careers get to jump in and gain experience right away\nEmployee journey support system (career coach)\nThe culture of trust, transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, autonomy... to name a few\nThe awesome people that work here (of course)\nFlexible work schedule\nTraining and development opportunities when we can support them\nWe recently asked Habs to share what they feel makes us one of the Best Places to Work in Canada and the loudest response was 'our people' (with 'our teams' and 'balance' not far behind). So, if this sounds like something you want to be a part of, and you have the skills and experience to contribute, then we want to meet you!"

Thanks for taking the time to apply!\n\nA little bit about Habanero\nHabanero is a Canadian consulting company with offices in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. We are passionate about helping people and organizations thrive. We believe that every organization can be exceptional, and we help to humanize the world of work through the creation of modern workplaces and the cultural, communication, collaboration and content experiences that power them. Our solutions are globally recognized, and we have consecutively ranked as one of Canada's top ten best places to work for the last 11 years. Habanero is proud to be ranked #9 on the Great Place to Work® Canada List of Best Workplaces™ for 2021.\n\nThe best kind of work\nHabanero is an organization where people who are creative, hard-working, friendly, honest and open come together to do great work. We have a shared passion for solving complex issues that will benefit other people and organizations. We only hire people we can count on, so you can be certain that you are joining a team of happy and competent team members. We service our clients and projects across Canadian time zones and consultants are resourced on cross-regional teams.\n\nSupporting each other in personal growth\nWe are a lattice organization, meaning that there is no traditional hierarchy. There is no typical boss, and you don’t report to a manager. Instead, we have a more holistic approach to mentorship – we offer employee journey coaches who are there to help you with all things career and life. We believe it’s up to you to make the most out of your career, and we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way.\n\nA diverse culture of clever humans\nAt Habanero, we celebrate diversity and inclusivity. We are committed to creating and supporting equal employment opportunities regardless of age, race, ancestry, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. We have included a personalized submission field in our application form to provide an additional opportunity for you to tell your story outside of the traditional resume and cover letter.\n\nCompensation\nOur compensation package includes a technology allowance, a wellness allowance, flexible work hours, the option to work from home, health and dental coverage, a health spending account and RRSP matching. We also enjoy smaller perks like free snacks and drinks and group lunches where you can reconnect with your team after a long week. There are training and development opportunities for those who wish to continue evolving their skills. All employees start at three weeks of vacation.\n\nBringing life to work\nEveryone at Habanero probably has their own story around this, but it's probably safe to say that it starts with people feeling like they can bring their whole selves to work. The cornerstone idea is that we want to support people having great lives, not just great work lives (we can't say our relationship begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00). Other things we've heard make the difference for Habs:\nPeople starting their careers get to jump in and gain experience right away\nEmployee journey support system (career coach)\nThe culture of trust, transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, autonomy... to name a few\nThe awesome people that work here (of course)\nFlexible work schedule\nTraining and development opportunities when we can support them\nWe recently asked Habs to share what they feel makes us one of the Best Places to Work in Canada and the loudest response was 'our people' (with 'our teams' and 'balance' not far behind). So, if this sounds like something you want to be a part of, and you have the skills and experience to contribute, then we want to meet you!"

We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About RaceAt Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis.

As a leading Health and Wellness provider for millions of Canadians, our goal is to help all Canadians \"Live Life Well\". In support of this goal, we have adopted a COVID-19 Vaccination Policy to protect the health and well-being of our employees as we continue our phased approach of office reopening.

We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About RaceAt Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis.

We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse.
