Dans le but de répondre aux besoins toujours croissants des applications demandant de hautes performances (e.g. calcul nuagique, supercalculateurs, communications haute vitesse), la puissance des MCM augmente continuellement, et avec elle la quantité de chaleur à dissiper. Dans ce cadre, les déformations en cisaillement induites par les contraintes thermomécaniques peuvent provoquer des problèmes de délaminage au niveau des interconnexions des puces. Il serait ainsi souhaitable de pouvoir mesurer de manière précise la répartition des déformations thermomécaniques au niveau des billes de soudure des puces à l’intérieur du MCM. Cela permettrait d’en optimiser la conception et d’en augmenter la fiabilité afin de prévenir des défaillances prématurées et irréversibles. Cela autoriserait aussi d’améliorer les outils de simulation d’IBM à l’aide de données expérimentales jusque-là inaccessibles. Nous proposons donc un projet de thèse visant à développer des capteurs micrométriques et innovants de déformation directement intégrés dans le « back-end-of-line » (BEOL) des puces autour des billes de soudure.Sujet de recherche : Ce sujet de thèse portera sur l’exploration et l’étude de nouvelles approches pour la réalisation de micro-capteurs de déformation directement intégrés dans le BEOL de puces microélectroniques. En s’appuyant sur les procédés et expertises du groupe de recherche du Pr. Dominique Drouin dans les domaines de la micro-fabrication et de l’encapsulation avancée, l’étudiant(e) sera en charge de (i) concevoir des capteurs de déformation devant être intégrés sous forme de matrice sur silicium. Des matériaux émergeants tels que les nanotubes de carbone, le graphène ou le disulfure de molybdène (MoS2) seront envisagés, (ii) développer et réaliser le procédé complet de micro-fabrication des capteurs en salle blanche ainsi que leur caractérisation morphologique, (iii) mettre au point un banc de test et des protocoles permettant de mesurer des déformations dans des puces de test induites par des charges mécaniques et/ou thermiques contrôlées, (iv) réaliser des mesures de déformations de puces assemblées sur substrat organique selon les standard de l’industrie, (v) améliorer les modèles de simulations thermomécaniques déjà existants à IBM grâce aux données expérimentales récoltées.Cadre de travail : Ce projet sera réalisé sous la co-direction des Pr. Dominique Drouin (UdeS) et Pr. Hélène Frémont (IMS Bordeaux, France) dans le cadre de la Chaire de Recherche Industrielle IBM/CRSNG sur l’Intégration Hétérogène à Haute Performance. L’étudiant(e) collaborera aussi avec Pr. Yann Beilliard et les équipes d’ingénieurs en charge du projet à IBM Canada (Bromont). Le travail sera effectué à l’Institut Interdisciplinaire d’Innovation Technologique (3IT) de l’Université de Sherbrooke, et au Centre de Collaboration MiQro Innovation (C2MI) à Bromont. Le 3IT est un institut unique au Canada, spécialisé dans la recherche et le développement de technologies innovantes pour l’énergie, l’électronique, la robotique et la santé. Le C2MI est un centre international de collaboration et d’innovation dans le secteur des MEMS et de l’encapsulation.

In order to meet the ever-increasing needs of high-performance applications (e.g. cloud computing, supercomputers, high-speed communications), the computing power of MCMs is continually increasing, and with it the amount of heat to be dissipated. In this context, thermomechanical stress induce shear deformations that can cause delamination problems at chip interconnects. It would therefore be desirable to be able to precisely measure the distribution of thermomechanical strains at the level of the chip solder balls inside the MCM. This would help optimize the design and increase reliability to prevent premature and irreversible failures. It would also allow IBM's simulation tools to be improved using experimental data that were previously inaccessible. We therefore propose a thesis project aimed at developing innovative micrometric strain sensors directly integrated in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) of the chips around the solder balls.Research project: This PhD project will focus on the exploration and study of new approaches for the realization of strain micro-sensors directly integrated in the BEOL of microelectronic chips. Based on the processes and expertise of the research group of Prof. Dominique Drouin in the fields of micro-fabrication and advanced packaging, the student will have to (i) design strain sensors to be integrated in the form of a matrix on silicon. Emerging materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene or molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) will be considered, (ii) develop and implement the complete process of micro-fabrication of the sensors in clean room as well as their morphological characterization, (iii) develop a test bench and protocols to measure deformations in test chips induced by controlled mechanical and/or thermal loads, (iv) perform strain measurements of chips assembled on organic substrates according to industry standards, (v) improve the thermomechanical simulation models already existing at IBM thanks to the experimental data collected.Work environment: This project will be carried out under the co-supervision of Prof. Dominique Drouin (UdeS) and Prof. Hélène Frémont (IMS Bordeaux, France) as part of the IBM/CRSNG Industrial Research Chair on Heterogeneous Integration for High Performance Computing. The student will also collaborate with Prof. Yann Beilliard and the team of engineers at IBM Canada (Bromont). The work will be done at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Technological Innovation (3IT) at Université de Sherbrooke, and at the MiQro Innovation Collaborative Center (C2MI) in Bromont. 3IT is a unique institute in Canada, specializing in the research and development of innovative technologies for energy, electronics, robotics and health. C2MI is an international center for collaboration and innovation in the MEMS and packaging fields. It is the essential link between applied research and the microelectronics industry. The candidate will thus benefit from an exceptional research environment combining students, professionals, professors and industrialists working hand-in-hand to develop the technologies of the future.Researched profile: · Specialization in nanotechnology and advanced packaging· Strong adaptability, autonomy and teamwork· Strong taste for design, experimental cleanroom work, research and development· Strengths: In-depth knowledge of microfabrication technologies and strain sensorsDocuments to provide:  CV, transcripts of the last 2 years, motivation and recommendation lettersINCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS WILL NOT BE EVALUATEDDurée du contrat : 36 moisLa durée du contrat : 36 moisJob Types: Full-time, TemporarySalary: $21,000.00 per yearSchedule:Monday to FridayEducation:Master's Degree (required)Language:English (required)Français (preferred)Work remotely:No"

      "description": "Academic\nJob Category\nFaculty Non Bargaining\nJob Profile\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\nJob Title\nPostdoctoral Fellow: Single-molecule microscopy of RNA-based medicines and vaccines\nDepartment\nResearch | Leslie | Michael Smith Laboratories | Faculty of Science\nCompensation Range\n$1.00 - $500,000.00 CAD Monthly\nPosting End Date\nMarch 15, 2022\nNote: Applications will be accepted until 11:59 PM on the day prior to the Posting End Date above.\nJob End Date\nMar 31, 2023\nATTN: APPLICANTS\nPlease do not apply via the UBC Careers website. To apply, please submit the application to leslielab@msl.ubc.ca.\nApplication made via the UBC website will not be reviewed.\nThank you.\nThe Michael Smith Laboratories at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, invites applications for a Postdoctoral Fellow (PDF) to join a dynamic team under the supervision of Dr. Sabrina Leslie. The successful candidate will work on a project that applies new biophysical tools to the development of genetic medicines and vaccines. The position is based in a cutting-edge academic research lab and the project will be driven by real and immediate needs, in collaboration with interdisciplinary scientists in the Nanomedicine Center of Excellence (NMIN).\n\nAbout the high-throughput single-molecule CLiC imaging technology\n\nThe Leslie Lab’s single-molecule technology, Convex Lens-induced Confinement (CLiC), works by squeezing molecules into arrays of nanometer- to micrometer-scale “traps” that are large enough to allow the molecules to move and interact freely, but small enough to keep them confined so they can be imaged over extended periods with a high-powered optical microscope. The result is the world’s first tether-free and high-throughput single-molecule technology for analyzing individual molecular interactions in cell-like conditions. CLiC is capable of detecting, following, and understanding rare molecular events – like the drug/target interactions which can ‘silence’ genes associated with the onset of diseases – and by enabling direct visualization of how the drugs work, help us better engineer them.\n\nAbout the position\n\nThe PDF will join a talented, energetic, interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers working in a newly built laboratory. Our team collaborates with the spin-off company ScopeSys to respond to partnerships with leading drug and vaccine development research groups and companies. The emphasis of this position will be on applications of our single-molecule and single-cell imaging technology to improve and accelerate development of lipid-nanoparticle and RNA-based medicines and vaccines.\n\n\nThis project will require an interdisciplinary skill set, combining physical, chemical and biological expertise. The ideal candidate will possess experience and interest in some of the following areas:\nMicroscopy of molecules, nanomaterials, cells\nInstrumentation, optics, engineering\nMicro/nano-fabrication and lithography\nSurface science and chemistry\nDNA, RNA, lipid nanoparticles, cells\nBiophysical assay and protocol development\nElectronics, mechanical engineering, machining\n\nThe successful candidate will have a PhD and a demonstrated track record in research with first authored peer-review publications. The position will be filled by a well-organized, enthusiastic team player with strong communication skills, who enjoys hands-on lab work and creative trouble-shooting, and who is excited to try new things. Applicants should have a strong interest in building a career in biotechnology and/or nanotechnology research and development, pioneering new biophysical techniques, and commercializing cutting edge science and technology.\n\nApplication process\n\nInterested applicants should submit a letter of application that highlights their experience, detailed curriculum vitae including a list of publications, and contact details for 3 references. Application materials should be combined into a single PDF document and sent to leslielab@msl.ubc.ca. Please include “PDF in single-molecule biophysics and biotechnology” in the e-mail subject line. Incorrectly addressed applications will not be considered. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. We will contact you only if invited for an interview."
