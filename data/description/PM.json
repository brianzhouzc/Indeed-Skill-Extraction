We encourage you to submit an application before the deadline as interviews are being conducted on a rolling basis”\nLength of Position: 1 year (possibility of renewal contingent on funding)\n\n\nThe Worker Solidarity Network is a province-wide organization that combats workplace exploitation within the unsurrendered homelands of approximately 200 Indigenous Nations across \"B.C.\"\n\nThis position would be based primarily on the Lands of the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), šxʷməθkʷəy̓əmaɁɬ təməxʷ (Musqueam), and S’ólh Téméxw (Stó:lō) Peoples.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Worker Solidarity Network (WSN) is a non-profit worker centre dedicated to ending precarious work in B.C. Our goal is to build collective worker power through the key pillars of our work, which include: support, education, and advocacy for workers whose rights are violated; workplace based direct action campaigns that are worker-led and help recover stolen wages; and broader province-wide campaigning to raise workplace standards and strengthen labour protections.\n\n In this exciting new position at WSN, you’ll be creating and leading our “Climate and Labour Project.” The Climate and Labour Project will center the voices of people working in B.C’s fast food industry who are impacted by the entanglement of precarious labour and the climate crisis. This project has the potential to expand beyond fast-food outlets to other areas of the food supply chain (e.g. agriculture, retail food etc.). The project will identify and bring attention to issues that intersect climate and labour making an impact on issues that matter to workers. Without predefining what these issues are, and to give prospective applicants an idea of some possibilities, these issues might include for example: the impacts of heatwaves on working conditions, food industry waste and emissions that impact workers health, wildfire impacts on workers, the impact of rising temperatures on workers, or global pandemics and their impacts on those working in fast food and along the food supply chain. Importantly, this project will integrate climate justice and workers justice calls for action into the Worker Solidarity Network’s campaigning.\n\nIdeally the successful candidate will be based out of Vancouver, B.C. While this is a strong geographically presence, we are open to other locations in B.C. for candidates who are a strong fit for the position.\n\n\nDuties and Responsibilities:\n\nCreate and carry out a worker-centered “Climate and Labour Project” to learn how workers in B.C.’s low-wage fast food industry (and possibly workers in other areas of the food chain) are being impacted by climate change.
