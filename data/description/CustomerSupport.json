      "description": "It’s all about the experience created, from the customer experience to the agent and teaminteractions in creating the best systems, process and services we can for our clients within a positive proactive way. A key role to any real estate team is the Team Administrator. This role has developed with the industry into so much more than just coordinating calls andappointments. A Team Administrator role is much more encompassing and core to the team and covers among others the following:i) Social Media: Working to coordinate, develop, tweak and schedule with consistency Social MediaStrategies for a real estate team to ensure we have not only a solid grow forward calendar of events but to ensure the pre-planning is there to coordinate all advance works to success. Social media is so ingrained into the marketing of real estate that the importance of working with the team to develop listing, sales process and coordinate key support players likevideographers, photographers, applications that ensure our social media posts are engaging and at the level that sets the bar higher.Our Team Administrator will embrace social media marketing and coordinate to ensure we have the best going forward for our clients and team all within process and systems thatensure consistency in delivery and efficiency in operation. If you do not know how toschedule and efficiently posts social media through multiple platforms, coordinate Facebook / Instagram and LinkedIn ads for maximum exposure to target areas and engagement and to utilize our web sites, software apps and design service providers to ensure we have the best social media marketing going forward and process driven responses and engagements than that’s ok for now. What is key to us is that you embrace this task and the development of a social media strategy that will make our team and clients properties stand out. We are not going 1/2 way on anything we utilize and the goal here will be to ensure we maximize all of our applications and service providers.Our Admin will ensure injuries, likes and commentators to our social media channels receive a direct interaction in return and will work to coordinate where practical through teammembers…(i.e. listing agent responses to inquiries, ensure follow-up is received). In addition will apply metrics to our social media and lead generation therefrom that providemeasurement and a directive growth plan to reach key strategic targets and objectives.ii) CRM: The customer relationship is centric to everything we do. We utilize a leading CRM thatprovides the ability to create solid customer interactions and flow through processes toensure our clients, team and lead opportunities receive the best customer interactionspossible. The successful applicant will not only work to create follow-up campaigns for lead engagement responses but work to develop within customer relationship experiencemanagement for our clients and to develop together with the Lead Real Estate Teamcustomer relationship process for the team and for our own interactions and updates to our team.Key to this process will be the ability to create system and process that ensures consistency of delivery every time all the time. Equally important to any CRM system is measurement that can be gained for metrics of responses from lead source. Tracking what works best, continually improving and providing the best relationship management we can for ourcustomers, strategic partners, support team and agents is core to the role.iii) Online: Our online content is key and we use a leading web site provider to ensure our web sites are easy to administer, update and manage from SEO through to DDF resources that can create engaging lead generation our web sites deliver. Our Administrator will managecontent, engagement, and ensure we have the best going forward for the Team. Theinternet is not static so ensuring were have planning and process to our online presence is key. A cross check attention to detail is key to any campaign or send out, test first andensure accuracy and the desired look and then run forward. Online is more than just web sites and while social media is key power tool for marketing it doesn’t stop there, there are services and providers that will ensure SEO its running and the ability to run SEM through Google Adwords through to ensuring our mapping business info is proper and updated as well as our reviews. Again here, process, procedure attention to detail and pre-scheduling / planning are key ingredients possessed by our Admin to ensure we have the best working for the team and our clients.iv) Video: We work with videographers to capture video but as well will be doing some of our own video marketing and utilizing some user-friendly software to ensure we have the quality and delivery necessary to ensure results. We see video as key to our marketing programgrowing forward. It is an innovative and unique way that can be very productive. The key is like any other part of our team structure plan, process and deliver consistent video content going forward that reflects our brand identity.Our Admin will be a key part to maintaining a process driven approach to our videomarketing and look for ways to utilize video into our CRM System to provide more engaging follow-up as well as to increase participation and reach within our video-based initiatives.v) Accounting and Deal Processing: The office we work within has exceptional admin who handle are deal processing side and provide regular income / expense and HST reporting to us. The core role of our admin within this is to ensure we have our core accounting and invoicing at hand, maintain and review budget forecasts ongoing and to provide a finger on the pulse resource to accessing the deal processing side and reporting we need to maintain ongoing oversight of our operations income, expenses and deal related to do’s and summary reporting.The primary focus of our admin from the deal side is the customer relationship side of the transaction from the reach out for Google Review (we can review approaches through third parties to systemize this) through to the delivery of reminders and organizational to ensure the key follow-up Sellers need throughout the sale process are delivered. Right down to the CRM integrations of key dates (house anniversary reminders), closing gifts and yearlygreetings at Christmas. While a level of accounting and admin is a key part of the role for our Administrative Coordinator it is not the core role, as that remains the customerrelationship management.Summary reporting and regular Leadership Review ongoing is a core part of theadministrative side of this role. An understanding of how to arrange basic accounting and recording tables inside of excel is key.vi) Meetings: An unplanned non-agenda driven meeting can, on the odd occasion be quite productive,however we are all very busy and a lead role to our admin is to ensure meetings occurregularly, agendas are pre-advanced reviewed and organized, informative strategic partners are from time to time brought in. Our Admin role is to ensure regular bi-weekly meetings are organized, structured and maintained regularly.We are also looking at better ways to coordinate meetings virtually so that we meet the needs of a growing team where work out of the office is factored into our structure. We have Zoom and we equally want to ensure connection to admin can be easy through zoom or other direct means of our team to connect to admin during regular hours for one-to-one video chat asrequired. Emails and text can never replace the value of a conversation, and this ties back into our goal to build, grow and nurture solid working relationships with our team.Lastly, no meeting is complete without a summary follow-up send of the key items covered within. So attention to the core details, the proactive sharing of input from all of the team and respect for all points of view to create a meeting where proactive engagement is welcomed is key. We do not expect our admin to start and run office meetings, but we do want anadministrator that can work towards that end and create a pro-active team centric culture for our office meetings. We are here to help; the key is getting the end goal to what a YRG Meeting is and how to create meetings that are planned and deliver solid value to the team.vii) Oversight: As part of the process of buying and selling real estate there are a lot of moving pieces. These include MLS Data Sheets, working with the graphical files, reviewing, and assembling core details, surveys, geo-reports, taxes and more. Core to the Admin process is theattention to detail that goes into the review and cross check of everything that crosses your desk. Review of numeric inputs, text and grammar, cross check and calendaring key dates and applying and developing consistent systems to ensure consistency to the process is key.We are looking for an Admin that has an eye for detail and will apply process to ensure that nothing slips through and will not be shy about following up with the team for thedeliverables needed and ensuring that the customer service experience is delivered through no dropped balls or outputs that do not meet our expectations.viii) Pro-Active To The Process: Our administrator is a key part of our team, your input is highly valued and together we can do great things for the team. We will look to our admin for valued input into the growth and development of the team and the culture we are building within the team and last but by no means least the customer experience we create.Closing Summary: The above reflects an overview of the role we are looking to have filled. We are very busy agents, and our time is limited occasionally so it goes without saying that an independentapproach and ability to get the goal and run with it is key. We equally respect that there is a learning curve, to some of the items mentioned here. We don’t except all skill sets to be at hand what is most important is the approach to growth and learning and to truly take success from growing this team forward through all applications and systems we apply.Job Types: Full-time, PermanentSalary: $40,000.00-$60,000.00 per yearAdditional pay:Bonus payBenefits:Company eventsOn-site parkingSchedule:8 hour shiftDay shiftEducation:Secondary School (preferred)Experience:Marketing: 1 year (preferred)Administrative: 1 year (preferred)"

      "description": "Company Description\nBorn in the North\nCanada Goose was born in the Arctic, where the difference between life and death, quite literally, hangs by a thread. It’s the only place where we can fully understand the what the meaning of “cold” really is, and it’s why we do what we do. But it’s not for everyone. Some call the Arctic landscape relentless. Dark, dangerous and uninviting. We call it home. It’s also home to the people of the North – the foremost experts in cold. Just as the Italians know knits and the British know wool, northern communities know parkas. Like us, they embrace living off the land and have a strong and meaningful respect for nature. We honour them, never losing sight of the wisdom we can learn from their patience, resilience and deep connection to all that surrounds them.\nOur Purpose - We inspire and enable all people to engage with the outside world.\nAt Canada Goose, nature is our North Star. We aren’t simply linked to nature – we’re guided and inspired by it. Our connection to the environment compels us to design functionally superior products so people can immerse themselves in the outside world. Our first parkas were made for northerners, those living in the coldest places on Earth. Today, our products continue to be designed for the extreme outdoors, but they’ve also been adapted for all aspects of modern life – past the four walls that shelter us and beyond our everyday experiences. Whether you’re crossing the rugged terrain of Antarctica or commuting in rush-hour during a downpour, we endure any extreme, observe every detail, and take the long view to make clothing that enables everyone to live out there, wherever “out there” is for them.\nOur Core Belief - Greatness Is Out There\nCanada Goose is more than a company that makes best-in-class outerwear. We’re a community that’s propelled forward by one core belief: greatness. Greatness has driven us to where we are today, and it’s always been at the heart of Canada Goose. It’s a journey, not a destination. Whether that means honouring traditional methods of craftsmanship, supporting explorers around the globe, or enabling people to discover more about the world, we’re moving towards something bigger than ourselves. Greatness is about making possibilities limitless, and creating your own definition of what it means to you here at Canada Goose.\n\nJob Description\nThe Team Lead partners with the Store Management Team and assists in the execution of the plans and strategies for their store location.
